                        <p>Hello! I am Cary and I am new to programming. I have a background in 
                            Cyber Security and started to code in my freetime. I found I enjoyed the 
                            challenge that it brings. I started with Python initally and my friend Kyle 
                            would give me little challenges here and there that were fun. Eventually, I asked my 
                            boss(?) if I could do something in Python that would be productive at work and I was given
                            a task that used Flask. This introduced me into the webpage and javascript side of programming. 
                            I took this and ran with it entirely updating our work application. After I finished that, 
                            I decided to take the Full Stack Developer course on Codecademy.com, which this page is a result of 
                            that. Mainly because it is a project in the course. 
                            <br><br>
                            In my freetime I like to workout and hangout with my wife and daughter. I am 
                            hoping that one day I grow my skills enjoy to create a website for my wife's photography! 
                            <br><br>
                            Well, I ran out of things to say. If you want to know more feel free to contact me at the link above!

                <p>I have worked on a number of projects. Unforetunately most of them are not able to be
                    viewed on here. However, you may visit one of my current work in process project. It 
                    is a website for my wife. You can see it <a href="https://carydrew.github.io/">here.</a>
